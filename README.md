# korbad_ansible_content

In active development. Assumptions are made about the local development / usage environment that are not completely self-automated, bootstrapped, nor documented. This will improve over time (unless this message doesn't get edited, this is my canary in the coal-mine, if it hasn't changed much... it might be dead :) ).

Much of the documentation in this set of composite ansible content (collections, playbook dirs, inventory dirs) will be generated by the automation... once it is completed (low priority)

## layers

### unspecified nomenclature
actions/action - not idempotent

past-tense - idempotent (e.g. 'configured', 'cloned')

### managed_*
utilizes coherent specification for locations on filesystem (e.g., managed ansible collections via ansible-galaxy, managed ansible-vault)

utilizes XDG Spec

### runtime_*
utilizes and configures the current logged-in graphical user's environment (e.g. $DISPLAY, i3 socket, dbus)

### defined_*
a specific instance of a resource (e.g. systemd-resolved drop-in config file for localhost dns, a defined set of managed ansible collections)
